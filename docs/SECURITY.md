# Security

## Credentials

Crimson stores API keys and bot tokens in the operating-system keyring when a supported keyring command is available:

- macOS Keychain through `security`
- Linux Secret Service through `secret-tool`

When a keyring is unavailable, Crimson uses an AES-256-GCM encrypted local vault under `~/.crimson`. The vault key and encrypted data file are created with owner-only permissions where the operating system supports POSIX modes.

Workspace configuration only contains references such as `keyring:openai-api-key`, `vault:telegram-bot-token`, or `env:OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Logs

The logger removes common API key, Discord token, and Telegram bot token patterns before writing JSONL logs.

Do not paste credentials into prompts. Revoke any credential that has been shared in an untrusted channel.

## Remote access

Telegram and Discord are owner-only in v0.2.0. A correct UID alone is not enough. The configured owner must also complete an expiring `/bind CODE` challenge.

## Terminal safety

Model and remote message text is sanitized before TUI rendering. OSC, DCS, CSI, and control bytes are removed to prevent terminal control injection.

## Workspace safety

Runtime state is stored inside the active workspace, but credentials remain outside the workspace. `.crimson/` is ignored by Git.
