# Crimson Odyssey v0.3.1 Verification Report

Date: 2026-07-23
Target repository: `aabrur/crimson-odyssey`
Target branch: `main`
Runtime: Node.js v22.16.0, npm 10.9.2

## Release status

The local release candidate passed source, package, onboarding, update, TUI layout, security, Loadout, provider, session, and mocked gateway verification.

Live Telegram, Discord, provider, and remote GitHub update checks were not executed in this build environment because external DNS resolution is unavailable. Credential-backed workflows and commands remain included without committing secrets.

## Commands executed

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm pack --dry-run
npm pack
npm install --prefix <temporary-prefix> ./crimson-odyssey-0.3.1.tgz
<temporary-prefix>/node_modules/.bin/crimson --version
crimson setup --no-tui

```

## Package evidence

- Package: `crimson-odyssey-0.3.1.tgz`
- Package contains the source, documentation, verification report, and build manifest
- Runtime dependencies: none
- The final SHA-256 is published with the generated artifact

## Update contract

- `notify` shows update availability without installation.
- `ask` requests confirmation before installation.
- `auto` installs only when update checks succeed and safety gates allow it.
- `off` disables update checks.
- Git updates require a clean working tree and use fast-forward-only pull.
- Workspace state under `.crimson/odyssey/` is not part of application updates.

## Known verification boundary

A real incoming Telegram message, Discord Gateway connection, live model reply, remote GitHub update, and tag-driven GitHub release require external network access. Unit and integration paths are verified locally, but live success must be confirmed on a networked user machine or GitHub Actions.
