# Crimson Odyssey

**Equip your agent. Enter the rift.**

Crimson Odyssey is a multilingual, loadout-driven terminal AI agent by Crimson Rift Studio. Version 0.3.1 adds one-command onboarding and a secure update lifecycle so normal users do not need to edit `.env`, JSON, or YAML by hand.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- An ANSI-capable terminal
- A provider API key, or a local Ollama or LM Studio server

## Install

### Git clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aabrur/crimson-odyssey.git
cd crimson-odyssey
npm link
crimson setup
```

### npm from GitHub

```bash
npm install -g github:aabrur/crimson-odyssey#main
crimson setup
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/aabrur/crimson-odyssey.git
cd crimson-odyssey
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\install.ps1
crimson setup
```

## One-command full setup

Run:

```bash
crimson setup
```

The wizard configures language behavior, Identity, Soul, provider, model, secure credential storage, starter Loadout, security profile, history retention, update behavior, and optional Telegram or Discord gateways. It writes project-local state automatically and can open the TUI when setup finishes.

Normal users do not need a `.env` file. Credentials are stored in an operating-system keyring when supported, with an AES-256-GCM encrypted vault fallback. Workspace files contain credential references only.

Use this to change only the active model later:

```bash
crimson model
```

## Updates

Crimson can check for updates on interactive startup, show a notice before the TUI opens, and provide dedicated CLI update commands.

```bash
crimson update status
crimson update check
crimson update apply
crimson update configure
```

Update modes:

- `notify`: show availability and let the user decide
- `ask`: request approval before applying
- `auto`: apply during interactive startup when safe, then request restart
- `off`: disable update checks

Git updates use fast-forward-only pull and refuse to run when the working tree is dirty. Application updates do not overwrite `.crimson/odyssey/` workspace state.

## Quick start

```bash
crimson doctor
crimson
```

In a wide terminal, the adaptive TUI displays an independently scrollable right sidebar. `Ctrl+B` toggles it. The transcript and sidebar scroll independently while the composer stays fixed at the bottom.

Useful commands:

```text
/model       Select provider and model
/loadout     Manage equipped skills
/session     Switch or create a session
/update      Check update status
/help        Show commands
/exit        Close Crimson
```

## Project-local state

Crimson initializes:

```text
.crimson/odyssey/
  soul.yaml
  identity.yaml
  heartbeat.json
  agent.yaml
  workspace.yaml
  config.json
  model.json
  memory/
  sessions/
  histories/
  loadouts/
  skills/
  gateways/
  logs/
  cache/
  state/
  revisions/
```

This directory is ignored by Git. Soul and Identity edits have revision history and rollback.

## Loadout

The default slot contract is:

- 1 Weapon
- 1 Armor
- 2 Accessories
- 2 Magic

The first turn loads the full equipped Loadout. Later turns inject only relevant context. External skills can be installed from `SKILL.md` or `skill.json`.

## Gateways

Telegram and Discord are owner-only. Setup stores bot tokens securely and writes only secret references into gateway configuration. The owner must complete an expiring `/bind CODE` challenge before remote messages are accepted.

```bash
crimson gateway list
crimson gateway doctor telegram
crimson gateway start telegram
```

## Verification

```bash
npm run verify
crimson doctor --json
```

The v0.3.1 local release candidate passed 55 automated tests, syntax verification, secret scanning, no-em-dash enforcement, package dry-run, local package installation, setup tests, TUI layout tests, and mocked gateway verification.

Live provider, gateway, and remote GitHub update success remains environment-dependent and must be proved on a machine with credentials and external network access.

See `docs/SETUP.md`, `docs/UPDATES.md`, and `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` for the complete contract.


## Automatic agent discovery

Run `crimson setup --auto` to detect supported local agent CLIs and standard provider environment credentials. Crimson can delegate model calls through an already authenticated Codex CLI, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI session without copying their private session tokens. Other detected agents are reported but are not used until a safe non-interactive adapter is available.

Credential setup is now provider-first: select provider, keep or replace an existing credential, enter a key only when required, then select the model. Secret input supports normal terminal paste on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
